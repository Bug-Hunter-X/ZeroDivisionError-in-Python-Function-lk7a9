This repository contains a demonstration of a common Python error: ZeroDivisionError.  The `bug.py` file showcases the error, while `bugSolution.py` provides a solution using exception handling. The error occurs when attempting to divide a number by zero. This is a runtime error that halts program execution. The solution incorporates a try-except block to gracefully handle the exception and prevent program crashes.
